# Rohith's personal projects

### A collection of software projects that I created over the years

You'll find various programming projects based on various front-end and back-end frameworks here. I designed these to learn end-to-end full stack development and start a career as a software developer.

If you're thinking about interviewing me for a job opening that you have, please contact me at: [rohith@rohithheg.de](mailto:rohith@rohithheg.de). You can also visit my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohith-hegde/).

## Coinfarm front end (2018)

An excerpt of the web application, written with Vue.js/Typescript/Node.js and the [CoreUI framework](https://coreui.io/vue-laravel/), that I designed and implemented for Coinfarm Technologies

## Coinfarm trading bot (2020, 2021)

A multi-tier application for trading cryptocurrencies based on a machine learning model.

1. **tradingbot-ai-regression-server**: a Python web service for predicting live market data against a Keras/Tensorflow 2 model. This is the heart of the stack.
2. **tradingbot-historical-backtesting-server**: a Node.js Typescript web service for testing the profit of market predictions against candlestick charts.
3. **tradingbot-ai-regression-backtest-combine-ts**: an ETL process for merging trade backtest results for evaluating strategies over time

The entire stack contains 15 or so applications, but I only uploaded 3 of them publicly.
